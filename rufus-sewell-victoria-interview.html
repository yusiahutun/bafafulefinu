A mainstay of rom-coms (A Knight's Tale, The Holiday), Hollywood epics (The Legend of Zorro, Hercules, Gods of Egypt) and costume dramas (Middlemarch, Kenneth Branagh's Hamlet, Tristan & Isolde), Sewell's been playing mustache-twirling villains, legendary kings, literary heroes and the undead—in various iterations and even combinations—for more than 25 years.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=2 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">This year, he brings this experience to two wildly different TV series: Amazon's The Man in the High Castle, playing Obergruppenführer John Smith, a Nazi in a world where the Axis powers won World War II, and Masterpiece PBS's Victoria as Lord Melbourne, Queen Victoria's first Prime Minister, close confidant and, the show suggests, first love. The two roles are complete opposites—which is exactly why Sewell was attracted to them: "These two opposing typecasts represent a pretty good statement of intent, or calling card," he says of his unorthodox career. Below, Sewell lets us in on all the things we didn't know about him: from falling in love with "Lord M," to Twitter's reaction to his relationship with the young Victoria, and his thoughts on the parallels between The Man in the High Castle and the United States's current political climate.</p><img alt="Ear, Dress shirt, Collar, Candle holder, Candle, Bow tie, Wax, Tie, Cylinder, Acting, " title="Ear, Dress shirt, Collar, Candle holder, Candle, Bow tie, Wax, Tie, Cylinder, Acting, " width=3942 height=2624 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hbz.h-cdn.co/assets/17/04/1485289067-victoria-ep1-7.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><a rel=noopener href=# class="pinterest css-1i6sckr e1c1bym14"><img data-dynamic-svg=true src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.harpersbazaar.com/_assets/design-tokens/fre/static/icons/social/pinterest.e8cf655.svg?primary=%2523ffffff" data-testid=dynamic-svg-base height=auto width=auto alt=pinterest style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">PBS</span><p>As Lord Melbourne on 'Victoria'</p><h2 data-node-id=6 class="question css-p3fpzg emevuu60">Yes, he's been typecast as a "bad guy" throughout his 26-year career—but it's starting to work out in his favor.</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=8 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">"When I was at drama school, my fear was that I would get stuck in the one thing that came naturally to me, which was comedy. I remember the first time I got offered to play a bad guy, it seemed like a wonderful opportunity to break away from the kind of brooding period drama characters that I always felt pigeonholed in. So I did it as an experiment and low and behold, I was trapped in a new typecast.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=11 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Over the past few years, I was being offered three or four really shit scripts to play bad guys in a row. Eventually you get offered one that's good and you think, "Well, okay, I can work with this," whilst always keeping an eye open for anyone imaginative enough to send something different. In the meantime, I certainly made the best of what I get. I never see characters I play in the same way, and often if I'm offered a character that is dark, if it's well written enough, I don't really have a problem with it. The only thing that is limiting is bad writing. Really, the one thing you're butting against is what was once described as the 'DVD liner notes.' How the character is described superficially.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=13 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">But I think it's suddenly coming to light now that I'm ending up being seen. In fact, coinciding with me not giving a f*ck how I'm seen, funnily enough, I think it's probably coming to pass that it's working out anyway. Now, I think people realize that what I've actually been doing all this time is acting, rather than just representing some 'type' that I am. And my career is panning out to be the one I kind of always wanted."</p><h2 data-node-id=15 class="question css-p3fpzg emevuu60">He's very flattered by Twitter's <a data-external=true href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://twitter.com/search?q=lord%20melbourne%20rufus%20sewell&src=typd" data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action=attraction class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">attraction</a> to Lord Melbourne—and loved playing the "brooding" Victorian.</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=17 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">"As a 49-year-old man, I am absolutely delighted and I have no qualms about it—excuse me, I'm just a piece of meat, thank you very much [laughs]. Part of me is very lucky to be having that kind of attention at all! And when I looked up Melbourne, he was actually a very attractive man and women really loved him. He aged very quickly toward the end, but about the time that Victoria met him, he was still quite an attractive man. He had an air of mystery about him. It's certainly not the way I regard myself, by the way—I don't think of myself the way that they describe me. But I am certainly not going to turn down any part on that account.

That character is very complex, he suddenly inhabits the darker realm and he's the ideal version of one stereotype, one typecast, which I decided to embrace and go as deep as I could. Suddenly on my doorstep arrives this other typecast that I used to battle with—the brooding Victorian lord. I read it and thought, 'You know what? I am so lucky to still be considered for this kind of role.' When I got this script, I realized that I not only identified in some way with Melbourne, but I just really liked him, which for me is not always the case. Often the job for me is to try to shine light on something dark or to try to find nuance in something that might seem kind of one-note on paper. That was not the case with Melbourne."</p><h2 data-node-id=23 class="question css-p3fpzg emevuu60">But he did think Lord M was a little too perfect at first.</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=25 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">"One of my vague concerns when I read the script was that he seemed to conform to so many echoes of literary types that we've [already] seen. I thought, if [their relationship] really was this interesting, wouldn't we know much more about it? I was slightly suspicious that he had been souped up for this kind of composite character.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=27 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">So I read everything I could and found out that he was so interesting and wonderful. I just couldn't get enough of him after a while. Even if in reading a whole book you only get one glimmer of something useful, A) you've read a wonderful book—if you're lucky, anyway—and B) that tiny, tiny, tiny thing could be the thing that unlocks [the character] for you and brings it closer to home and makes it real for you."</p><img alt="Dress, Outerwear, Coat, Formal wear, Suit, One-piece garment, Gown, Interior design, Day dress, Vintage clothing, " title="Dress, Outerwear, Coat, Formal wear, Suit, One-piece garment, Gown, Interior design, Day dress, Vintage clothing, " width=2904 height=4357 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hbz.h-cdn.co/assets/17/04/1485288988-victoria-ep3-3.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><a rel=noopener href=# class="pinterest css-1i6sckr e1c1bym14"><img data-dynamic-svg=true src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.harpersbazaar.com/_assets/design-tokens/fre/static/icons/social/pinterest.e8cf655.svg?primary=%2523ffffff" data-testid=dynamic-svg-base height=auto width=auto alt=pinterest style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">PBS</span><p>With co-star Jenna Coleman (Queen Victoria)</p><h2 data-node-id=31 class="question css-p3fpzg emevuu60">Sorry <a data-external=true href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://twitter.com/hashtag/vicbourne?lang=en" data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="#Vicbourne shippers" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">#Vicbourne shippers</a>, you can't rewrite history—it's Prince Albert's turn.</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=33 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">"My filming of Victoria kind of mirrored, in a way, the story. Jenna [Coleman] and I just really got off. We had a hoot from start to finish and from the first reading it was clear that we had a great rapport. And my filming was basically crammed in the couple of months before the lovely Tom [Hughes], who plays Albert, turned up. I was aware that this fun was coming to an end. Then Tom turned up, and there was this crossover couple of weeks where we were all staying in the same hotel and we all went out together. It was lovely, but there was this vague feeling that I was going to have to give up my playmate to someone else. I left, then it was his show. It was kind of bittersweet."</p><h2 data-node-id=35 class="question css-p3fpzg emevuu60">As a star of The Man in the High Castle, he thinks the comparisons between today's political climate in the U.S. and Nazi Germany are disrespectful—except for one element.</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=37 class="p1 css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">"What was interesting about the book [that The Man in the High Castle is based on] when it was written [in 1962] and what is still interesting about it now, although it may seem sometimes slightly more vivid than anticipated, is that it's about the process of normalization. It's about the stories people tell themselves so they can get on with their lives, the stories people construct so they can live it and occupy it and be the center and the good person in their story, and it happens in the most extraordinary, horrific circumstances.</p><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p0"></span>"The mass of Germany who went along with [Nazism] managed to do so by choosing to be ignorant, by choosing not to look at uncomfortable, inconvenient truths."<span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p1"></span><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=41 class="p1 css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">The idea that everyone evil lived in Germany from 1933 onwards is a fallacy that's probably quite comforting for us to say—we can create these monsters, these others that encapsulated evil for us. It's comforting but it's very dangerous because there were normal people in Germany. I don't mean that people that started Nazism, you know, Goebbels and Hitler and all his really warped and deranged, horrific henchmen, but the people, the mass of Germany who went along with it managed to do so by choosing to be ignorant, by choosing not to look at uncomfortable, inconvenient truths. I mean, the reason that Nazism was so successful is that Goebbels was so brilliant at manipulating the media and that no one read any news from all over the world, and by the time the Germans marched into Poland, they felt universally that they were the victims who were finally standing up to themselves. People can convince themselves of anything. Countries can convince themselves of anything, and now I have no doubt that a large proportion of the people living in our version of Nazi America [on The Man in the High Castle] believe that they are living in a heroic, noble moral land.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=43 class="p1 css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">So it's a very salient lesson on how if we aren't careful, these things, well not only can these things happen in America, but they have. It's how America started. I don't mean to overstate it but there have been genocides before and the people committing those genocides seem to sleep in their beds and get up and you know, make holidays. When the book was written it meant the same thing as it means now. It's about what people do in order to normalize."</p><img alt="Sitting, Comfort, Leather, Leather jacket, Shelf, Acting, Boot, " title="Sitting, Comfort, Leather, Leather jacket, Shelf, Acting, Boot, " width=4240 height=2832 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hbz.h-cdn.co/assets/17/04/1485288757-the-man-in-the-high-castle-season-two-mithc-201-03003-rgbs.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><a rel=noopener href=# class="pinterest css-1i6sckr e1c1bym14"><img data-dynamic-svg=true src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.harpersbazaar.com/_assets/design-tokens/fre/static/icons/social/pinterest.e8cf655.svg?primary=%2523ffffff" data-testid=dynamic-svg-base height=auto width=auto alt=pinterest style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">Amazon</span><p>As Obergruppenführer John Smith on 'The Man in the High Castle'</p><h2 data-node-id=47 class="question css-p3fpzg emevuu60">He once called Donald Trump a "catastrophic knob-end" on Twitter.</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=49 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">"One can say so many things, but specifically after Meryl Streep said what she said, to describe to her as overrated, I was [like], 'Oh, f*ck off.'
