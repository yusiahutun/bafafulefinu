Here, 11 women reveal their physical scars—and open up about the mental ones—to break the stigma and set the record straight.</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=3 class="body-dropcap css-803sjt emevuu60">Renee Marhong was sure she knew exactly how things were going to go. She’d go into labor naturally and head to the hospital with her baby’s father. She’d push a couple of times, and then the doctor would gently lay her first child on her chest.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=4 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Instead, at 32 weeks pregnant, her son stopped moving inside her, and to save his life, she delivered via cesarean section. Marhong was 25, and her only experience with childbirth was the Hollywood version: a smooth, uncomplicated, vaginal delivery. When she didn’t get that, she says, she felt “robbed of that experience you see on TV. Like I did get the baby, but without the recognition, without that happy moment.”</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=5 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">When Marhong was wheeled into the operating room to deliver her son via C-section, she became one of the more than <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/fastats/delivery.htm data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="1.2 million" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">1.2 million</a> American women who have babies that way every year. According to the Center of Disease Control’s National Center for Health Statistics, 32 percent of all births in the U.S. happen via C-section, a number that’s risen dramatically in recent decades.</p><img alt="White, Black, Facial expression, Brassiere, Smile, Beauty, Black-and-white, Monochrome photography, Lip, Skin, " title="White, Black, Facial expression, Brassiere, Smile, Beauty, Black-and-white, Monochrome photography, Lip, Skin, " width=1080 height=1440 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/10-1567012319.png style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">KAT IRLIN</span><p>Before getting pregnant, Renee Marhong's only experience with childbirth had been the Hollywood version: a uncomplicated vaginal delivery.</p><img alt="Black, Stomach, Monochrome photography, Black-and-white, Skin, Hand, Abdomen, Monochrome, Joint, Organ, " title="Black, Stomach, Monochrome photography, Black-and-white, Skin, Hand, Abdomen, Monochrome, Joint, Organ, " width=1080 height=1080 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/10-1567011642.png style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">KAT IRLIN</span><p>Marhong was 25 when she delivered her first child via emergency C-section. She says she felt “robbed of that experience you see on TV.”</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=9 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">There are two reasons for a C-section; those that happen in an emergency situation, when the mother or baby is in jeopardy, and elective C-sections, which can be scheduled and planned for ahead of time. By and large, the procedure is safe. So safe, in fact, that more and more mothers-to-be are opting for the latter, electing to schedule a C-section rather than wait to go into labor naturally. There are, of course, any number of reasons to choose a C-section: It can reduce the chance of long-term pelvic floor and incontinence issues, and can be scheduled at both the parents’ and doctors’ convenience, ensuring that your obstetrician—and not the stranger who happens to be on duty when you go into labor—delivers your baby. When a mother has a condition like high blood pressure or obesity, is over the age of 35, or if the baby is “breech” (positioned butt- or feet-first in the birth canal), the pregnancy may be considered “high risk.” In those cases, an elective C-section can be the best way to ensure that both mom and baby get through delivery safely.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=10 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">But a C-section is still major abdominal surgery, and as rates of the procedure rise, so does the risk of complications—and lasting emotional trauma—for mothers. Studies and statistics find that women who deliver via C-section are more likely to have medical issues including uterine ruptures and emergency hysterectomies. Even when all goes well physically, the ordeal can contribute to postpartum mental health issues.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=11 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Despite how common the procedure has become, C-sections are rarely portrayed on TV, and little has been done to normalize the conversation around them. Add to that common misconceptions about C-section—that it’s “the easy way out” or a vanity-driven choice—and a dip in self-esteem that can accompany the tell-tale scarring, and women may face a physical and mental recovery period that takes months, or even years.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=12 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60"><strong>______</strong></p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=13 class="body-dropcap css-803sjt emevuu60">Two weeks after giving birth to her second son, Lazlo, in 2017, Jenny Mollen shared a mirror selfie on Instagram.

Throughout her pregnancy, Mollen posted nude or almost-nude photos, and wrote openly about being diagnosed with placenta previa, a condition where the placenta covers the cervix. She knew from the start of her second pregnancy that she’d likely deliver Lazlo via C-section, just as she had her first son, Sid.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=17 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">“My mom had to have an emergency C-section; she never dilated,” Mollen says. “So, going into my first pregnancy I felt like, ‘oh my God, this is going to happen to me.’ I tried and tried, I labored for hours, I mean like 16 hours. [The doctor was] like, ‘You're like half a centimeter dilated. There's a 99 percent chance you're not going to have this baby vaginally.’ At that point I was like ‘alright, just fucking cut me.’”</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=18 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">For her second C-section, Mollen felt more prepared and less anxious, and explains that she wanted to help other women, if she could. “For me, it wasn’t a scary thing. I feel like a lot of women have fear and anxiety around it, and I wanted to show the progression of what it looks like a week after, two weeks after.”</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=19 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">While that kind of openness is normal for Mollen, she’s the exception to the rule. Many women hesitate to reveal their C-section scars, which can vary from straight and barely-there, like Mollen’s (she had a laser procedure to make it less visible) to more jagged and prominent. Some retain a “flap” of scar tissue above or below their scar. Others end up with two scars; one vertical, one horizontal. But while millions of women carry these scars, many say they had no idea what their scar “should” look like. These ten mothers agreed to be photographed because they believe that needs to change.</p><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p0"></span>We’re sold a fairy tale, and women are afraid to share the reality.<span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p1"></span><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=21 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">“Before this photo shoot, I was like, ‘Oh my god, what am I doing?’ But I know women need to see it,” Marhong says. “I need to see this. People need to see this, so we can normalize it. Millions of women get C-sections and we really don’t discuss it at all. It’s important that we normalize it that so many people have the scar, and that you get that little piece of fat there, and it’s whatever, it’s fine.”</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=22 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">It’s not just the scarring that goes undiscussed. Most childbirth classes include only a passing mention of C-section, if they cover it at all.

Her mother told her the story of her easy, vaginal birth, and, she says, “I anticipated that mine would follow a similar pattern.” After King’s delivery turned into an emergency C-section, she says, the mental impact of not being able to deliver vaginally was deep and lasting. “When I started to unpack what I actually felt in those moments…” King trails off, close to tears. “Sometimes when I think about it—I’m not going to say I’m not whole. I’m not going to say that.”</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=39 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Dekel’s study of hundreds of postpartum women suggests that while around 6 percent of women overall are likely to develop symptoms of CB-PTSD, that number jumps to near 20 percent with an unplanned C-section.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=40 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">“The sense of helplessness and uncertainly and loss of control; these all put people at risk for PTSD,” she says. “Especially when there’s a discrepancy between your planned birth and what happens.”</p><img alt="Black, Glasses, Eyewear, Black-and-white, Skin, Beauty, Arm, Smile, Shoulder, Muscle, " title="Black, Glasses, Eyewear, Black-and-white, Skin, Beauty, Arm, Smile, Shoulder, Muscle, " width=1080 height=1440 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/3-1567012188.png style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">KAT IRLIN</span><p>After Kimberly King’s delivery turned into an emergency C-section, she says the mental impact of not being able to deliver vaginally was deep and lasting.</p><img alt="Abdomen, Stomach, Black, Monochrome photography, Trunk, Black-and-white, Skin, Close-up, Organ, Muscle, " title="Abdomen, Stomach, Black, Monochrome photography, Trunk, Black-and-white, Skin, Close-up, Organ, Muscle, " width=1080 height=1080 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/3-1567011283.png style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">KAT IRLIN</span><p>“While my C-section scar has healed well in the eight years since my son’s birth, the emotional journey to healing ebbs and flows,” says King, 43.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=43 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">In 2010, journalist and master profiler Taffy Brodesser-Akner wrote an essay for <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.salon.com/2010/02/18/ptsd_in_childbirth/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action=Salon class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">Salon</a> about the birth of her son. After a stalled induction and 30 hours of labor, she delivered via C-section. It wasn’t until four months later that a psychiatrist labeled her flashbacks, night terrors, and deep sadness with a name: PTSD.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=44 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">“Remember that at the root of trauma is fear,” Brodesser-Akner wrote in 2010. “In my case, intervention after intervention left me more scared, more sure that no one was looking out for me. When they told me that both my baby and I were in distress — my heart rate was off the charts, and he'd been experiencing contractions for more than a day — I could not see an outcome in which things turned out OK. That feeling that you're in danger, when it stays with you, is the essence of PTSD.”</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=45 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Dekel is currently studying an additional hypothesis that emergency C-sections also lead to CB-PTSD at an increased rate because of an instant shift in hormones.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=46 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">“There are drastic biological and physiological and hormonal changes in the context of having a C-section,” Dekel says. “It’s a rollercoaster of hormones, and a drastic interruption in the natural birth experience. It could be that the combination of biological and psychological stressors increases the risk for elevated psychiatric symptoms postpartum.”</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=47 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">At most hospitals, Dekel says, part of a postpartum evaluation is a routine screening for depression. “Nobody is screening for PTSD,” she says. And, considering the rate of C-section births in the U.S. is at 32 percent and rising, “there are a lot of women who are potentially at risk.”</p><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p0"></span>The recovery was the worst pain I’ve ever felt in my life.<span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p1"></span><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=49 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Even women who don’t develop symptoms of PTSD may not be getting the support they really need to effectively heal. After a normal vaginal delivery—assuming there are no serious complications—a new mom is up and moving within a day or so. During a C-section, a surgeon slices through the abdominal wall and its attached muscles, then makes a second incision in the uterus. Once the baby and placenta are delivered, both are stitched back up. For as long as six weeks, recovering mothers aren’t able to engage their core muscles at all. That means things like sitting, standing, or lifting a newborn are nearly impossible to do without help.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=50 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Tyla Jones Champion, 28, had an emergency C-section after the umbilical cord became wrapped around her daughter’s neck during labor. The recovery “was the worst pain I’ve ever felt in my life,” Champion says. “I couldn’t do anything. You never realize it, but you use your stomach for everything.”</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=51 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Champion’s boyfriend and mother were with her for the first few days after her delivery, but “everybody had to go back to work sooner than I hoped,” she says. It was weeks before she felt like she could even get in and out of bed normally. “They tell you to plan,” she says, of the days immediately following childbirth. “Plan this, plan that. Then it’s, ‘Oh, crap. Now I have a C-section and an extra four weeks recovery time.” Aspects of recovery, she adds, just can’t be planned for. “You have to relearn everything about your body: how to cough the right way, or sit the right way when you’re going to the bathroom, or how to squat to pick something up when the baby drops it. It’s very, very difficult.”</p><img alt="Brassiere, Black, Face, Hair, White, Lip, Facial expression, Lingerie, Beauty, Skin, " title="Brassiere, Black, Face, Hair, White, Lip, Facial expression, Lingerie, Beauty, Skin, " width=1080 height=1440 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/11-1568220759.png style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p>Tyla Jones Champion, 28, had an emergency C-section after the umbilical cord became wrapped around her daughter’s neck during labor.</p><img alt="White, Skin, Joint, Close-up, Black-and-white, Monochrome photography, Leg, Abdomen, Arm, Knee, " title="White, Skin, Joint, Close-up, Black-and-white, Monochrome photography, Leg, Abdomen, Arm, Knee, " width=1080 height=1080 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/11-square-1568220782.png style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p>The recovery “was the worst pain I’ve ever felt in my life,” Champion says. “I couldn’t do anything.

Jessica Delfino, 42, remembers the birth of her son, Wyatt, via C-section as “kind of nice” in its painlessness. “But there's no way to escape it because afterwards the pain was like a real kick in the guts,” she says. “For a couple weeks it hurt pretty badly. I would have to do things like take the baby and lift him to nurse him. They gave me medicine, but the medicine made me feel so foggy, and I wasn't really sure how gentle I was being with the baby. I couldn't really feel his weight, and he was so light.

But the National Center for Health Statistics reported in 2013 that <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.today.com/health/two-weeks-after-baby-more-new-moms-cut-maternity-leave-4B11229443 data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="16 percent" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">16 percent</a> of new moms only took between one and four weeks, and nearly a third didn’t take any formal time away from work. For some, this is because maternity leave isn’t even an option: The <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.dol.gov/general/topic/workhours/fmla data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Family and Medical Leave Act" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">Family and Medical Leave Act</a> requires that companies with more than 50 employees offer up to 12 weeks of leave to employees who’ve been at the company at least a year. But if you or your workplace don’t meet those requirements, there’s no law that protects your job while you recover. Plus, the FMLA simply makes sure your position is waiting for you when you get back. It doesn’t require your company to pay you while you’re gone, meaning that leave could be completely unpaid. Many families simply can’t withstand a 12-week-long loss of income.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=63 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">The result is that many women end up going back to work much too soon after major abdominal surgery, and sacrificing the benefits that come with taking time off to bond with their newborn. Studies show a strong correlation between mental health and maternity leave: The longer the leave, the fewer depressive symptoms were recorded.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=64 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Delfino says that while she’s grateful for the modern medical practices that helped her deliver safely, it was a year before she felt physically normal, and much longer before she really felt like herself again.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=65 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">“I was really mentally affected by my C-section, as much or more so than physically,” Delfino says. “I felt almost betrayed, in a sense, by my body. That was an emotional thing I had to work through and come to terms with.”<br></p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=66 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">But this, too, is often swept under the rug. The stigma associated with C-section is tough to shake, and it can make things that much tougher for postpartum moms. “You can feel like a failure, like you didn’t do it the way god—if you’re religious—intended,” Marhong says. “Some people say things like, ‘Oh, you took the easy way out,’ which is completely insane.”</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=67 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">But when women internalize the misconceptions that a C-section and the recovery is somehow easier, or, at least, as straightforward as vaginal delivery, they can be left feeling confused, depressed, and bitter, and like they’re not entitled to the help they really need.</p><img alt="Brassiere, Black, White, Clothing, Lingerie, Undergarment, Beauty, Undergarment, Monochrome photography, Black-and-white, " title="Brassiere, Black, White, Clothing, Lingerie, Undergarment, Beauty, Undergarment, Monochrome photography, Black-and-white, " width=1080 height=1440 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/7-1567012260.png style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">KAT IRLIN</span><p>Jackie Helchowski has undergone three C-sections—the first, at age 21, was an emergency; the second and third were planned to avoid rupturing the scar on the uterus.</p><img alt="Abdomen, Stomach, Black, Trunk, Skin, Chest, Waist, Navel, Organ, Muscle, " title="Abdomen, Stomach, Black, Trunk, Skin, Chest, Waist, Navel, Organ, Muscle, " width=1080 height=1080 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/7-1567011508.png style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">KAT IRLIN</span><p>“I was a little vain about my scar,” Helchowski admits. “And I did feel cheated out of childbirth.”</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=70 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">“It’s rough,” Marhong says. “It’s not just sadness.

Humans have been performing C-sections for millennia. References to C-section births appear in folklore and historical records from the ancient Greeks to the ancient Chinese, but the name is most likely derived from “caedare;” Latin for, “to cut.” And, of course, it wasn’t always the relatively low-risk procedure it is today.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=73 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">“The indications for it have changed dramatically from ancient to modern times,” writes Dr. Jane Elliott Sewell, in a 1993 brochure that accompanied an exhibit on the procedure at the National Library of Medicine. “Despite rare references to the operation on living women, the initial purpose was essentially to retrieve the infant from a dead or dying mother; this was conducted either in the rather vain hope of saving the baby's life, or as commonly required by religious edicts, so the infant might be buried separately from the mother. Above all it was a measure of last resort, and the operation was not intended to preserve the mother's life.”</p><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p0"></span>I felt betrayed by my body.<span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p1"></span><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=75 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Today, a C-section, especially one performed because mom or baby is in distress, can be very much a life-saving measure.

Additionally, the research team believes doctors, who ultimately benefit more from the pricier and quicker surgical procedure than from a long, drawn-out vaginal birth, are incentivized to push their patients toward an unnecessary C-section.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=79 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">For the nearly five percent of women whose babies are in a breech presentation when they reach term, a C-section may be a foregone conclusion.

Nobody else is doing vaginal breech [deliveries] and if you're a doctor in the hospital with malpractice insurance credits like everybody else, why would you want to be the one person who’s going to stick your neck out when you can just do a C-section and get a healthy baby?”</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=81 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Wills feels the culture is shifting, and as doulas and midwives become more common in maternity wards, vaginal breech births <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://m.acog.org/Clinical-Guidance-and-Publications/Obstetric-Care-Consensus-Series/Safe-Prevention-of-the-Primary-Cesarean-Delivery data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="may increase" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">may increase</a> too.

For instance, long-accepted practice says that once a woman has a C-section, any subsequent babies will need to be born the same way to avoid rupturing the scar left on the uterus. These repeat C-sections also contribute to the rising rates: nearly <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/birt.12386 data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="90 percent" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">90 percent</a> of women in the United States who’ve had a C-section will deliver that way again, despite studies, like one published in the medical journal <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/epdf/10.1111/birt.12386 data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action=Birth class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">Birth</a> last year, that find close to half of those same women say they’d like to have a vaginal delivery. In fact, the common belief that a VBAC (vaginal birth after cesarean) is riskier than scheduling another C-section is totally off-base. While risks do exist, successful VBAC deliveries result in lower morbidity, fewer transfusions, emergency hysterectomies, and ICU admissions.</p><img alt="Black, Shoulder, Skin, Beauty, Lip, Hairstyle, Arm, Joint, Muscle, Chest, " title="Black, Shoulder, Skin, Beauty, Lip, Hairstyle, Arm, Joint, Muscle, Chest, " width=1080 height=1440 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/9-1567012299.png style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">KAT IRLIN</span><p>At 24, Linda Nader had every intention of having vaginal child birth. “But I looked like a teenager, and I really feel like they treated me as a teen mom,” says Nader, now 43.</p><img alt="Abdomen, Stomach, Skin, Trunk, Organ, Muscle, Hand, Monochrome photography, Waist, Black-and-white, " title="Abdomen, Stomach, Skin, Trunk, Organ, Muscle, Hand, Monochrome photography, Waist, Black-and-white, " width=1080 height=1080 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/9-1567011595.png style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">KAT IRLIN</span><p>Nader was given Pitocin before her water was forcefully broken, eventually leading to an emergency C-section. “They did not have empathy towards me,” she says.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=88 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">But though the risks of a VBAC are low, when complications do happen, they can be extremely serious.
