Ring announcer Dasha introduced the wrestlers for the opening match…</p><p><strong>1. Bryan Danielson, Claudio Castagnoli, Mark Briscoe, and Daniel Garcia vs. Brody King, Jay White, Rush, and Jay Lethal (w/Sonjay Dutt, Jose) in an eight-man tag match.</strong> Matt Menard sat in on commentary. Early in the match, Danielson was setting up for a finale kick on White when Garcia tagged himself into the match.</p><p>Garcia entered the ring and teased doing his dance, but he ducked a shot from King, who came back with a Bossman Slam. King and Garcia ended up at ringside. King got in Menard’s face and pie-faced him. Menard stood up and asked if he wanted to go. King said Menard wouldn’t “do shit” and called him a bitch. McGuinness encouraged Menard to take a seat or risk being fined.</p><p>Garcia was isolated by his opponents. Garcia eventually made the tag to Briscoe, who had a flurry of offense on White. Danielson roughed up Rush on the floor. Briscoe performed a neckbreaker off the apron on Lethal. Briscoe returned to the apron and dropped a Cactus Jack Elbow on Rush.</p><p>A short time later, Castagnoli and King were the legal men. Castagnoli hit King with a series of rapid fire uppercuts. Castagnoli went for a suplex that was blocked by King. Castagnoli escaped King’s suplex attempt and caught him with a boot to the face before performing a vertical suplex. Castagnoli went for the cover, but Rush broke up the pin.</p><p>Lethal and Garcia ended up in the ring together. Lethal caught Garcia, who had a bloody nose (I believe from an earlier exchange with King), in a Figure Four. Briscoe performed Froggy Bow onto Lethal to break it up. There was a series of rapid fire big moves from the various wrestlers that was capped off by Garcia executing a Saito Suplex on King. Lethal went for the Lethal Injection, but Garcia avoided it and then pinned Lethal.</p><p>Bryan Danielson, Claudio Castagnoli, Mark Briscoe, and Daniel Garcia defeated Brody King, Jay White, Rush, and Jay Lethal in 17:50 in an eight-man tag team match.</p><p>After the match, Briscoe encouraged Garcia to do his dance and they did it together.</p><p><span><strong>Powell’s POV:</strong></span> This match would have been so much easier to follow had the wrestlers just worn red and blue t-shirts. Yes, I’m kidding. This was a solid opener that featured eight of the wrestlers from the Continental Classic. There was nothing at stake, but I like that they gave Garcia a moment by having him get the pin while also extending Lethal’s losing streak.</p><p>A video package set up the Miro vs. Andrade match…</p><p><strong>2. Miro vs. Andrade El Idolo (w/CJ Perry).</strong> Perry had the middle finger on her right hand wrapped after being hospitalized for an infection. Miro hit Andrade from behind. As is customary in AEW, the referee rewarded the cheap shot by calling for the opening bell to start the match.</p><p>Miro was dominant and exchanged words with Perry. Andrade eventually came back and dumped Miro over the broadcast table. Back inside the ring, Miro superplexed Andrade. Andrade battled back and performed a moonsault from the middle rope onto Miro on the floor. Andrade ran Miro back first into the ring steps and then hugged Perry.</p><p>Andrade went for a moonsault and landed on his feet when Miro moved, then followed up with a standing moonsault for a two count. Miro came back with a big kick and then barked that it was game over. Miro applied his Game Over (Camel Clutch) finisher. Andrade’s arm slipped away and he reached the ropes to break the hold. Miro barked at Perry for cheering.</p><p>Andrade caught Miro with a dragon screw leg whip over the middle rope. Miro blocked a kick from Andrade, who then hit him with the back elbow for a good near fall. Andrade applied the Figure Eight submission hold, but Miro immediately rolled over to reverse it.</p><p>Andrade got back on his back and maintained the Figure Four before bridging into the Figure Eight. Perry reached inside the ring and pulled Andrade’s arms to break the hold. Andrade looked at Perry in disbelief and then took a big boot from Miro, who covered him for a near fall. Miro applied the Game Over and got the submission win.</p><p>Miro defeated Andrade El Idolo in 14:45.</p><p>After the match, Perry blew a kiss to Miro, who just looked down at her before getting his arm raised. Miro left the ring and teased throwing Andrade’s mask into the crowd, but he smiled and set it down again…</p><p><span><strong>Powell’s POV:</strong></span> An enjoyable match with a couple of strong near falls. Perry’s involvement in all of this has been baffling. That said, it’s good to see her back following her serious medical scare.</p><p>A video package set up the AEW Women’s Championship match…</p><p><strong>3. Toni Storm (w/Luther) vs. Riho for the AEW Women’s Championship.</strong> Tony Schiavone joined the broadcast team in place of McGuinness. commentary in place of McGuinness. Storm had athletic tape on her left shoulder. Storm performed an early bodyslam and went for the cover, but Riho slipped out from under her.</p><p>Riho went for a bodyslam of her own, but Storm didn’t budge. Riho threw a pair of dropkicks instead and followed up with a knee strike in the corner. Riho bulldogged Storm and covered her, but Storm kicked out before the one count. Riho kicked Storm, who ducked out to ringside.</p><p>Riho dove off the apron and was caught by Luther, who passed her to Storm, who then bodyslammed her on the floor. Storm brought Riho back inside the ring and covered her for a two count. Riho sold back pain, which Storm exploited by targeting her lower back and then walking on it. A “Toni” chant broke out. Schiavone joked that he knew the fans were into him on Long Island.</p><p>Storm put Riho in a Texas Cloverleaf. Riho reached for the ropes. Luther pulled the bottom rope back. Referee Rick Knox caught Luther and ejected him from ringside. Riho battled back with a series of elbow strikes and then hit Storm with her version of the 619. Riho went up top and executed a crossbody block. Storm popped up. Riho picked up Storm and dropped her before selling her lower back, then covered Storm for a two count.</p><p>A short time later, Storm hit the Storm Zero and went for the pin. Riho stared at the referee and kicked out at the last moment. Riho picked up a couple of quick two counts. Riho went to the middle rope and was pulled down violently by Storm, who then pulled Riho over her back and then dropped her into a DDT that led to the three count…</p><p>Toni Storm defeated Riho in 11:40 to retain the AEW Women’s Championship.</p><p>After the match, Mariah May walked to ringside carrying a bucket. Once in the ring, May pulled rose pedals out of the bucket and showered Storm with them. May held the ropes for Storm, who went to the apron and held up her title belt…</p><p><span><strong>Powell’s POV:</strong></span> This was Storm’s best match since she adopted the Timeless persona. It’s obviously a big adjustment, but it’s encouraging that she found a better balance of fun character schtick and working a quality match.</p><p>Excalibur issued condolences to the families of Killer Khan and Mad Kurt…</p><p>Dante Martin was interviewed by Lexi Nair. Martin said he’s doing good, but he needs to be doing great. He spoke about getting the pin in a six-man tag match on Rampage and nearly pinned a champion. Orange Cassidy showed up said he knew where this was going. Martin said that Cassidy has his respect and he would shake his hand at the end of it, but he needs his title. Cassidy told him to try to take it on Wednesday’s AEW Dynamite…</p><p>Justin Roberts introduced Swerve Strickland, who came out with Prince Nana. Dustin Rhodes was introduced (he’s replacing Keith Lee). Swerve dropkicked Dustin while he was on the apron before the match. Swerve went to ringside and ran Dustin into the ring post and the ring steps. Swerve hit Dustin with a running knee against the ring steps. Nana pulled out a cinderblock and placed Dustin’s leg on it. Swerve went to the apron, looked to the crowd, and then double stomped Dustin’s angle.</p><p>Trainers and a few referees tended to Dustin, who sold it as if he was unable to put weight on his ankle. Dustin turned back and faced the ring. Swerve smiled and motioned for Dustin to get in the ring. Dustin limped with help from the referee and then rolled inside the ring. Dustin used the ropes to pull himself up and demanded that they ring the bell to start the match…</p><p><strong>4. Swerve Strickland (w/Prince Nana) vs. Dustin Rhodes.</strong> Strickland went right at Dustin once the bell rang. Swerve hit Dustin with a dropkick to his knee. Excalibur wondered if this was going to be the end of a 35-year career. Taz said they wouldn’t know the severity of the injury until Dustin removed his boot.</p><p>Swerve got Dustin in a seated position on the top turnbuckle and then went for a superplex that Dustin blocked. Rhodes headbutted Swerve off the top rope and then struggled before executing a crossbody block that got him a two count. Swerve threw a kick at the back of Rhodes’ knee. Rhodes caught him with a kick, a Destroyer, and a powerslam for a near fall.</p><p>Dustin put Swerve in position for the Shattered Dreams kick. Nana climbed onto the apron and protested. Dustin performed the Shattered Dreams while the referee was distracted and then knocked Nana off the apron. Dustin put Swerve down with CrossRhodes and covered him for a near fall.</p><p>Swerve eventually battled back and hooked Dustin’s bad leg around his neck before throwing punches at him. Dustin reached the ropes to break the hold. Dustin got up and got in Swerve’s face while saying, “Come on, motherf—er.” Swerve kicked Dustin’s bad leg. The kneeling Dustin gave him the double bird and then spat in his face. Dustin flipped off Swerve, who hit him with a couple of leaping kicks. Swerve pulled Dustin’s arm behind him and used his foot to “snap it.” Swerve went up top and performed a double stomp and then scored the pin.</p><p>Swerve Strickland defeated Dustin Rhodes in 9:30.</p><p>As Swerve was headed to the back, he turned and looked at the camera. Swerve said not to waste his time with shit like that anymore. He motioned for a title belt…</p><p><span><strong>Powell’s POV:</strong></span> I was surprised to see Dustin get so much offense after the ankle injury spot. As much as they tried to make Dustin feel sympathetic, the crowd was still largely behind Swerve to the point that there was a “one more time” chant after Swerve caught him with a pair of kicks. Swerve continues to be the rising star of the company and Dustin came out of this looking fine as the veteran who would not quit.</p><p>A video package set up the second of the show’s two eight-man tag matches…</p><p>Chris Jericho made his entrance to his “Judas” entrance theme and it sounded like the majority of fans sang along. The remainder of the entrances followed and Don Callis was serenaded with a “F— you, Callis” chant…</p><p><strong>5. Sting, Darby Allin, Chris Jericho, and Sammy Guevara vs. Ricky Starks, Big Bill, Powerhouse Hobbs, and Konosuke Takeshita (w/Don Callis) in an eight-man tag match.</strong> Guevara and Takeshita started. Guevara tried to tell Takeshita that he didn’t need to be aligned with Callis, but Takeshita blew him off.</p><p>Jericho tagged in and was met with some boos. Jericho and Guevara struck their pose. A short time later, Allin checked in and was hit with an avalanche helicopter blue thunder bomb from Takeshita. Hobbs tagged in and worked over Allin in the heel corner. Dot Net contributor Don Murphy is in attendance at the show and noted that there was a “Kylie Rae” chant at one point.</p><p>Sting took a hot tag and received a big pop. Starks did his rope strut while holding onto the arm of Sting and then jumped off the ropes and hit him. It looked like Sting went for a Hot Shot on Starks, but he dropped him in front of the ropes instead and then tagged out.</p><p>Jericho tagged in and was booed again while he hit a Codebreaker on Bill, who no-sold it. Bill picked up Jericho and awkwardly slammed him to the mat and then mounted him and threw punches at him. Jericho caught Bill with boots in the corner and was booed by some fans.</p><p>Hobbs tagged in and performed a spinebuster on Jericho and followed up with a powerslam. Hobbs hoisted up Jericho again, but Allin ran in and springboarded onto Jericho, which drove him onto Hobbs. Takeshita checked in and performed a double German suplex on Allin and Guevara.</p><p>Sting tagged in and put Takeshita in the Scorpion Death Lock. Don Callis ran in with a bat, which caused Sting to release the hold. Callis fled the ring without doing anything. Jericho put Hobbs in the Walls of Jericho and then Sting reapplied the Scorpion Death Lock on Takeshita. Starks broke up both holds.</p><p>Starks caught Guevara with a spear and covered him for a near fall. Starks set up for his finisher, but Guevara slipped away and superkicked him. Guevara hit Starks with the GTH. Guevara went up top and there were boos before hit hit a shooting star press and then pinned Starks.</p><p>Sting, Darby Allin, Chris Jericho, and Sammy Guevara defeated Ricky Starks, Big Bill, Powerhouse Hobbs, and Konosuke Takeshita in 15:40.</p><p>After the match, Sting’s partners stood back and pointed at him and then the live crowd applauded him. Sting left the ring and then visited Vladimir, the super fan who was featured in the touching WWE documentary that’s available on Peacock.</p><p><span><strong>Powell’s POV:</strong></span> The finish would seem to suggest that the plan going into the show was to move forward with Jericho and Guevara getting a tag team title shot. I wonder if they will reconsider based on the crowd’s reaction to Jericho once the match started. Tonight’s media scrum should be very interesting. Let me guess? That’s a great question, but I can’t answer it due to legal reasons? I sure hope not. On a side note, it’s bizarre that AEW isn’t doing more to promote Sting’s final matches. I’ve wondered if they’ve avoided hyping his non-wrestling appearances in the various cities as his last because they intend to use him in a non-wrestling role after his retirement match, but there’s no good reason for not doing more to market his final matches.</p><p>A brief video package set up the TBS Title match. Abadon came out to a flat reaction. Julia Hart entered to a better reaction…</p><p><strong>6. Julia Hart vs. Abadon for the TBS Championship.</strong> Abadon performed an early cutter. The House Rules called for no rope breaks and biting to be allowed. Fans chanted “This is spooky.” Hilarious. Hart battled back and suplexed Abadon at ringside. Hart smiled and then rolled back inside the ring. Hart remained in offense control until Abadon bit her arm twice.</p><p>Abadon threw a couple of clotheslines. Abadon hit double knees in the corner and then executed a Codebreaker style move. A short time later, Hart cut off Abadon, who was on the ropes. Abadon bit Hart, who backed away and was checked on by the referee.</p><p>Skye Blue ran out and threw Abadon off the ropes. Abadon got right up and then went to ringside and pulled Blue out from underneath the ring and roughed her up. Abadon hit Blue with a knee to the face. Hart went to the floor and hit Abadon from behind. Hart slammed the back of Abadon’s head against the side of the ring steps repeatedly.</p><p>Hart rolled Abadon back inside the ring. Hart went up top and performed a moonsault and landed on her feet more than on Abadon. Hart covered Abadon for the three count. Excalibur tried to cover for the finisher by saying that Hart came down with her knees on Abadon (she did not).</p><p>Julia Hart defeated Abadon in 11:55 to retain the TBS Championship.</p><p>Hart celebrated her win with Blue, who kicked Abadon out of the ring…</p><p><span><strong>Powell’s POV:</strong></span> The live crowd clearly wasn’t invested in Abadon as a challenger. The fans humored themselves a couple times but they were mostly just quiet. This looked like a Rampage match on paper and it didn’t need 12 minutes.</p><p>A video package set up the TNT Title match and the fans in the building cheered. Entrances for the match took place. Adam Copeland came out first and then rushed the stage when Christian Cage made his entrance. Copeland ran Cage into the video wall on the stage. Copeland brought Cage to ringside and ran him into the barricade. Cage took a canned drink from a fan, drank some, and then slammed the can on his forehead, which opened a small cut.</p><p><strong>7. Christian Cage (w/Nick Wayne, Shayna Wayne) vs. Adam Copeland in a No DQ match for the TNT Championship.</strong> Nigel McGuinness joined Excalibur and Taz on commentary, meaning he replaced Schiavone. Apparently, the bell rang at some point before they entered the ring. Copeland tried to stomp Cage’s head on the ring steps, but Cage moved.</p><p>Cage hopped the barricade and walked up the steps in the crowd. Copeland followed Cage. Nick Wayne followed them and went after Copeland, who put Nick down with ease. Copeland went to the top of a section and jumped off the guardrail onto both heels below, which drew cheers and “holy shit” chants.</p><p>Copeland brought Cage back to ringside and then jumped off the barricade and clotheslined him. A “You’ve still got it” chant broke out. In the ring, Copeland mounted Cage in the corner and threw punches at him. Copeland went for a spear, but Cage sidestepped him and shoved him through the ropes and into the ring post, causing Copeland to tumble to the floor. A “Who’s your daddy” chant broke out.</p><p>Cage had Copeland’s head on the ring steps when he stomped the back of his neck. Cage rolled Copeland inside the ring and covered him for a two count. Coepland had a cut and some swelling around his left eye. Cage pulled out a kendo stick from under the ring. Once he was back inside the ring, Cage hit Copeland with multiple kendo stick shots. Cage used the kendo stick to choke Copeland.</p><p>Cage stood over Copeland and drove the kendo stick onto his neck and then covered him for a two count. Cage looked into the camera and blew a kiss. Nick was back at ringside. Cage had Nick slide two chairs inside the ring. Cage placed chair over Copeland’s back and neck and posed, then sat on the chair while performing a Boston Crab. Copeland powered up and then Cage released the hold and kicked his back to slow him down.</p><p>Cage got a metal rod and swung it at Copeland, who ducked, and then took Cage down. Copeland slammed a kendo stick over the back of Cage’s head and then worked him over with it. “In front of his own son,” McGuinness said. Funny. Copeland applied a crossface. Cage reached for the rod and then Copeland took it away and used it while applying the crossface.</p><p>Copeland pulled out a ladder from underneath the ring, which got a big pop from the crowd. Copeland placed the chair in the corner over the middle turnbuckle and then catapulted Cage’s face into it. Copeland and Cage ended up fighting on the ladder once it was set up near a corner of the ring. Cage slammed Copeland’s face on a run and then performed a sunset bomb off the ladder that led to a near fall.</p><p>Cage pulled a pair of tables out from underneath the ring and set one up on the floor. Cage tried to suplex Copeland from the apron, but Copeland fought out of it. Copeland ran the ropes for a spear. Nick pulled Cage off the apron to spare him. Copeland went to the floor and hit Cage with a kendo stick and a chair.</p><p>Back inside the ring, Copeland slammed a chair over the back of Cage and then performed an Impaler DDT onto a chair. Copeland put Cage in position for a Conchairto while the fans chanted, “This is awesome.” Copeland wound up with the second chair, but Nick ran in and took it away. Cage low-blowed Copeland and then rolled him up for a near fall.</p><p>Cage set up a table in a corner of the ring. Cage tried to spear Copeland, who leapfrogged him and then threw a chair at Cage twice before spearing him through the table (Cage wisely put his hands up the first time and the second hit his shoulder).</p><p>Copeland covered Cage and had him beat, but Shayna pulled the referee out of the ring. Copeland left the ring to go after Shayna, but Nick hit him from behind and then hit Wayne’s World before rolling him back inside the ring, Cage performed the Killswitch and covered Copeland for a good near fall.</p><p>Cage and Nick doused a table on the floor with lighter fluid, which drew “holy shit” chants. Cage told Copeland to go f— himself. Nick lit the table. Copeland avoided whatever Cage had in mind and then speared him. Copeland got the better of Nick, but the flames on the table went out. Copeland poured lighter fluid on it and reignited the flame.</p><p>Copeland powerbombed Nick, whose ass hit the burning table. Shayna cried out for her son. Copeland returned to the ring. Cage ran over to hit Copeland with the title belt, but Copeland kicked him in the balls. Copeland performed the Killswitch and pinned Cage.</p><p>Adam Copeland defeated Christian Cage in a No DQ match in roughly 25:00 to win the TNT Championship.</p><p>Copeland celebrated with the title in the ring and then Killswitch entered the ring behind him. Killswitch clotheslined Copeland from behind and then chokeslammed him onto the title belt. Killswitch set up a chair and then chokeslammed Copeland onto the seat.</p><p>Killswitch pulled out his contract for his TNT Title shot and was about to give it to the referee. Cage returned to the ring and told Killswitch to give it to him. Cage whispered into Killswitch’s ear. Killswitch hung his head like a dog and handed over the contract, which Cage signed and handed to the referee…</p><p><strong>8. Christian Cage vs. Adam Copeland for the TNT Championship.</strong> Referee Paul Turner told Justin Roberts that the match was on. Cage speared Copeland and then pinned him to regain the title.</p><p>Christian Cage defeated Adam Copeland in 0:11 to regain the TNT Championship.</p><p>Afterward, Cage and Shayna headed up the ramp together while Killswitch carried Nick to the back. Copeland got to his feet while the trainer stood by him. Fans cheered for Copeland as he exited the ring and was helped to the back via the side of the ramp…</p><p><span><strong>Powell’s POV:</strong></span> That was an epic title reign for Copeland! The first match was really good and the crowd was hotter for it than anything else on the show. It probably went a few minutes longer than it needed to and the burning table spot was bad, but I really enjoyed the brawl and the way they got the title back on Cage. I thought they might have Killswitch enter during the first match to help Copeland, but I like the approach they took a lot more. This show really needed that match to deliver and it did.</p><p>A video package set up the Continental Classic tournament final… Eddie Kingston made his entrance via the stage and then Jon Moxley entered through the crowd…</p><p><strong>9. Eddie Kingston vs. Jon Moxley in the finals of the Continental Classic tournament to become the first Triple Crown Champion.</strong> Bryan Danielson sat in on commentary with Excalibur and Taz. Excalibur said there was no time limit and there must be a winner. Danielson said he made a lot of mistakes in his tournament match with Kingston that Moxley would not make.</p><p>Kingston went for an early suicide dive and went over the top of Moxley before his head hit the barricade. Kingston got back in the ring and Moxley hit him with a German suplex. Kingston came up holding his head as he rolled to the floor. Moxley followed and put him down with a Paradigm Shift. Kingston sold his head and neck while shaking his hand before returning to the ring.</p><p>Moxley threw a kick that Kingston stuffed. Kingston stood up and fired chops at Moxley in the corner. Moxley blocked a forearm strike with his arms. Kingston sold forearm pain and Moxley pounced on him. Moxley executed a piledriver for a two count.</p><p>A short time later, both men traded chops in the middle of the ring. Moxley got the better of it and flipped off Kingston, who fired back with another chop. Kingston flipped off Moxley. Kingston eventually knocked Moxley down with a back fist, but Kingston was too weary to cover him.</p><p>Kingston got Moxley in the corner and threw rapid fire chops at him while calling him a mofo. Kingston performed a DDT and then played to the crowd. Moxley came right back with a cutter, but Kingston hit him with another back fist. Moxley bounced off the rope and hit Kingston with a lariat. Kingston came right back with a Northern Lights Bomb for a near fall.</p><p>Kingston put Moxley in a choke and then released it to throw elbows at his head. Kingston reapplied the choke hold. Moxley slipped away and caught Kingston in a choke and then grapevined him. Kingston slipped away momentarily and then Moxley reapplied the hold. The referee checked Kingston’s arm, which dropped twice and then he held it up the third time.</p><p>Moxley applied the choke while Kingston was on his feet. Danielson called for Moxley to drop back, but Kingston fell forward into the ropes. Moxley gave the crowd double birds and then approached Kingston, who hit him with another spinning back fist. Moxley stared at the referee and kicked out when Kingston went for the pin.</p><p>Kingston put Moxley down with another Northern Lights Bomb for a near fall. Both men got up and traded strikes. Kingston connected with another spinning back fist that dropped Moxley. Kingston covered Moxley and got the three count.</p><p>Eddie Kingston defeated Jon Moxley in 17:20 to win the Continental Classic tournament to become the first AEW Triple Crown Champion.</p><p>Kingston was presented with the ROH Championship and the New Japan Strong Openweight Championship belts. The referee handed Kingston the new belt that is dark and has a crown in the middle of it. Kingston celebrated with the belts and then put them down. Kingston dropped to his knees and looked at Moxley, who was also on his knees. A “You deserve it” chant broke out.</p><p>Kingston and Moxley got to their feet and hugged. Moxley left the ring and then Kingston went back to celebrating with the three belts. Kingston looked into the camera and said, “Mad Kurt, respect.” Kingston went to the stage, put the titles down, and then looked at them for a moment before heading to the back…</p><p><span><strong>Powell’s POV:</strong></span> A good match with the right finish. It pleased the live crowd to see Kingston win in his home state, and Kingston gains more from winning than Moxley does.</p><p>Excalibur hyped Orange Cassidy vs. Dante Martin for the AEW International Championship for Wednesday’s AEW Dynamite, and “FTR” Dax Harwood and Cash Wheeler vs. Malakai Black and Buddy Matthews for Saturday’s AEW Collision…</p><p>A video package set up the main event… Samoa Joe made his entrance. A video package aired with folks from Long Island speaking favorably about MJF. They mocked the idea that MJF “lost his fastball” and became friendly and weak. A woman said she and MJF once f—ed in the back of her parent’s car and then was censored. All the people in the video listed him as “our scumbag” and put scarves on. Once the video ended, the live crowd chanted, “He’s our scumbag”…</p><p>MJF made his entrance. He held his arms out and his robe read, “The most magical place in the world.” Once MJF was in the ring, Adam Cole was introduced and he headed to the ring using crutches. Cole got on the apron and spoke with MJF…</p><p><span><strong>Powell’s POV:</strong></span> The video was fun and the live crowd ate it up. Great stuff. Of course, all eyes will be on Cole from now until they pay off The Devil angle.</p><p><strong>10. MJF (w/Adam Cole) vs. Samoa Joe for the AEW World Championship.</strong> Justin Roberts delivered in-ring introductions for the championship match. Joe was booed, MJF was cheered, Cole got a “Boom” from the crowd, and referee Bryce Remsburg was booed. MJF wore a harness over his left shoulder and had it heavily taped. MJF poked Joe’s eyes early and put the boots to him in the corner.</p><p>Joe quickly regained control and performed a leg drop on MJF’s bad shoulder. MJF fired back with right handed chops, but then winced after throwing one with his left hand. Joe went right back on the offensive. Joe went for a Muscle Buster, but MJF escaped and landed on his feet. Joe charged MJF, who moved and pulled down the top rope, causing Joe to tumble to ringside. Joe returned to the ring and was caught in an inside cradle for a two count. MJF went for other quick pin attempts and continued to get two counts.</p><p>MJF played to the receptive crowd and signaled for the Kangaroo Kick. MJF went for the move, but Joe stuffed it and catapulted MJF over the top rope. MJF tried to skin the cat, but Joe booted him off the ropes and down to ringside. Joe hit MJF with a suicide dive. MJF grabbed his left shoulder after tumbling on the floor.</p><p>Back inside the ring, Joe executed a Death Valley Driver and covered MJF for a two count. Joe executed three wicked suplexes and covered MJF, who put his foot over the bottom rope to break the pin. Joe stood over MJF and shook his head while smiling. Joe set up for a move on the apron. MJF stuffed it, but Joe headbutted him. Joe executed a Muscle Buster that dropped MJF on his back shoulder on the apron. Cole flashed a look of disbelief and concern.</p><p>MJF rallied once they returned to the ring and threw punches at Joe while standing on the middle rope. MJF bit Joe’s forehead. MJF jumped off the middle rope and double stomped Joe’s wrapped left elbow. MJF followed up with a Heatseeker piledriver for a near fall.</p><p>Moments later, MJF applied the Salt of the Earth on Joe’s bad arm and used some wrist tape. Joe slipped out and then wrenched MJF’s bad shoulder with a submission hold. Cole encouraged MJF to reach for the ropes. MJF eventually did to break the hold. They got to their feet and Joe applied a sleeper hold. MJF shoved Joe into the referee. REF BUMP!!!</p><p>MJF low-blowed Joe, who was on the middle rope. MJF followed up with an F5. MJF made the cover and the referee slowly crawled over and counted, but Joe kicked out. MJF asked Cole for the Dynamite Diamond Ring. Cole struggled to find it and eventually passed it to MJF, but Joe caught him in the Coquina Clutch. The referee checked MJF’s arm, which fell three times. The referee hesitated and then told the timekeeper to ring the bell.</p><p>Samoa Joe defeated MJF in 17:50 to win the AEW World Championship.</p><p>Joe celebrated briefly and then headed to the back with the title belt. Cole rolled inside the ring and tried to give MJF a pep talk. MJF got back to his feet. The Devil’s crew showed up at ringside. Cole held up his crutch, but he was quickly taken down by one of the masked men, and then two men took down MJF. Another masked man held up a chair. MJF and Cole both pleaded to take the chair shot for the other. The lights went out.</p><p>When the lights turned on, Cole was seated in a chair with four men standing behind him. The masked men removed their masks to reveal Roderick Strong, Wardlow, Matt Taven, and Mike Bennett. MJF got up and spoke to Cole, but he was hit with a knee to the face by Strong. Taven and Bennett joined Strong in putting the boots to MJF. Wardlow powerbombed him. Cole pulled The Devil mask out of his jacket. Cole stood up and dropped the mask on MJF, then looked to the crowd and smiled. Cole knelt over MJF while his allies stood over him.</p><p><span><strong>Powell’s POV:</strong></span> I wonder how many pay-per-view buys they missed out on by not making it clear that all would be revealed tonight. Cole was the most logical choice from the start and I suppose this helps explain why they dragged it out so long. Is MJF going away to have surgery? It’s hard to imagine that Tony Khan would feature him as the top guy only to let him leave because his deal is up. This really will be one of the most interesting press conferences this company has ever had. Anyway, I’m happy for Samoa Joe to win a world championship at this point in his career. Good for him.</p><p>Overall, this was a decent show, yet not up to typical AEW pay-per-view standards.
